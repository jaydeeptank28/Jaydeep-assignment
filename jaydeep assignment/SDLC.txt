# What is software? What is software engineering?
=> Software is considered to be collection of executable programming code, associated libraries and documentations.
   Software, when made for a specific requirement is called software product. Engineering on the other hand, is all
   about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.


# Explain types of software
=> The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is software that 
   fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides 
   a platform for applications to run on top of.



# What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
=> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality,
   low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time.

    1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This phase involves gathering information about the software requirements 
                                            from stakeholders, such as customers, end-users, and business analysts.

    2. Design: In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software,
               data structures, and interfaces. It has two steps:
 
         High-level design (HLD): It gives the architecture of software products.
         Low-level design (LLD): It describes how each and every feature in the product
                                 should work and every component.

   3. Implementation or coding: The design is then implemented in code, usually in several iterations, and this phase 
                                is also called as Development.

                                things you need to know about this phase:

                                ~This is the longest phase in SDLC model.
                                ~This phase consists of Front end + Middleware + Back-end.
                                ~In front-end: Development of coding is done even SEO settings are done.
                                ~In Middleware: They connect both the front end and back end.
                                ~In the back-end: A database is created.

  4. Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.

  5. Deployment: After successful testing, The software is deployed to a production environment and made available to
                 end-users.

  6. Maintenance: This phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.


# What is DFD?
=> A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical or visual representation using a standardized set of symbols and notations to describe
   a business's operations through data movement.


#  What is Flow chart?
=> A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order. It is a generic tool that can be adapted for 
   a wide variety of purposes, and can be used to describe various processes, such as a manufacturing process, an administrative 
   or service process, or a project plan.


# What is Use case Diagram?
=> Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a system. These diagrams also identify the interactions between
   the system and its actors. The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it, 
    but not how the system operates internally.
